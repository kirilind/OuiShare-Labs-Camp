Have you wanted to explore the world of Bitcoin but don't know where to start? This is the workshop for you. You'll learn how to choose and set up a wallet, add security with 2-factor authentification, and buy BTC. You'll also set up a ChangeTip account and immediately receive BTC and be able to send it.

Attendees will need to bring a connected device (laptop, tablet, cell phone) with a browser and wi-fi.

A copy of this workshop will be also held at the [OuiShare Fest](http://sched.co/31Z3).
