This and more is what is enabled by the [Social Linked Data](https://github.com/linkeddata/SoLiD) architecture using only Web Standards such HTTP, TLS, Linked Data and JavaScript.
    
Come and get your own Social Web data space, try out the slick web app demos from the [SoLiD team](https://github.com/orgs/linkeddata/people), and even learn to build new apps yourself!
